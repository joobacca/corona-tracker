# Coding challenge SDA SE

Hello and welcome to this coding challenge solution! As you can see, I have chosen to implement the given web app using React and Material UI. 
It's a simple CRA app which you can run by following these two steps:
- Install the packages using `yarn` or, in case you don't have yarn installed, `npm i`
- To see the development build, run the `start` script, with yarn or npm (`yarn run start` or `npm run start`)
- To see the production build, build the project by running the `build` script (same as above) and copy the output (./build) into a publicly viewable folder of a web server of your choice (`xampp` can be helpful to keep it on your machine)
